# GatsbyJS

Static Site Generation

with ReactJS and GraphQL

---

## What is a Static Site?

 - Static really refers to the end result
 - Typically SSGs use a server side language/framework like Ruby, PHP, Go, Node, etc.
 - They provide a developer friendly environment to create "static" sites
 - During the build process it generates HTML, JS, and CSS that can be deployed pretty much without much configuration/devops.
 - In addition to your own server, there are a plethora of SaaS sites that will host static sties.  Even many that are free.  Netlify, AWS, and Surge are just a few.
 - No Database
